# Frontend Mentor - GitHub user search app

![Design preview for the GitHub user search app coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! üëã

Hello! Welcome to my FrontEnd Mentor project challenge where we are tasked to develop a search page that searches for all the github users using an API. To complete this project I used the following tech stack and resources:

- Jack Herrington on Youtube for React Resources [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6vRUjYqDuoUsYsku86Lrsw]
- React for the FrontEnd
- Typscript
- SASS/SCSS a CSS-preprocessor for the styling 
- Git for continuous integration and Github Pages for continous deployment

As a front-end developer, it's important to be used to working with API's therefore I wanted to become more familiar working with them and decided to complete this challenge. This gave me a further understanding of Promises and using the fetch() method when working and retreiving data from API's. The more I increase my knowledge about front-end development the more I realize how important it is to also understand the back-end(I guess you can say I'm beginning to lean more on the full-stack side). Becoming familiar with the back-end and learning how data is called, retreived, and displayed to the user allows me, as a developer, to expand my understanding how creating applications for users. 

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this GitHub user search app using the [GitHub users API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/users#get-a-user) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size (DONE)
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page (DONE)
- Search for GitHub users by their username (DONE)
- See relevant user information based on their search (DONE)
- Switch between light and dark themes (DONE)
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

Want some support on the challenge? [Join our Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack) and ask questions in the **#help** channel.

The GitHub users API endpoint is `https://api.github.com/users/:username`. So, if you wanted to search for the Octocat profile, you'd be able to make a request to `https://api.github.com/users/octocat`.

### Expected behaviour

- On first load, show the profile information for Octocat.
- Display an error message (as shown in the design) if no user is found when a new search is made.
- If a GitHub user hasn't added their name, show their username where the name would be without the `@` symbol and again below with the `@` symbol. (DONE)
- If a GitHub user's bio is empty, show the text "This profile has no bio" with transparency added (as shown in the design). The lorem ipsum text in the designs shows how the bio should look when it is present. (DONE)
- If any of the location, website, twitter, or company properties are empty, show the text "Not Available" with transparency added (as shown in the design). (DONE)
- Website, twitter, and company information should all be links to those resaources. For the company link, it should remove the `@` symbol and link to the company page on GitHub. For Octocat, with `@github` being returned for the company, this would lead to a URL of `https://github.com/github`. (DONE)

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the design file provided. We provide both Sketch and Figma versions of the design, so you can choose which tool you prefer to use. You can download the design file on the platform. **Please be sure not to share them with anyone else.** The design download comes with a `README.md` file as well to help you get set up.

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The assets are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized. Some images are reusable at multiple screen sizes. So if you don't see an image in a specific folder, it will typically be in another folder for that page.

The design system in the design file will give you more information about the various colors, fonts, and styles used in this project.


## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are many ways to host your project for free. Our recommend hosts are:

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

You can host your site using one of these solutions or any of our other trusted providers. [Read more about our recommended and trusted hosts](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/frontend-mentor-trusted-hosting-providers-bf000dfebe).


## Submitting your solution

Submit your solution on the platform for the rest of the community to see. Follow our ["Complete guide to submitting solutions"](https://medium.com/frontend-mentor/a-complete-guide-to-submitting-solutions-on-frontend-mentor-ac6384162248) for tips on how to do this.

Remember, if you're looking for feedback on your solution, be sure to ask questions when submitting it. The more specific and detailed you are with your questions, the higher the chance you'll get valuable feedback from the community.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT ‚ö†Ô∏è: With these premium challenges, please be sure not to upload the design files to GitHub when you're submitting to the platform and sharing it around. If you've created a brand new project, the easiest way to do that is to copy across the `.gitignore` provided in this starter project.**

## Sharing your solution

There are multiple places you can share your solution:

1. Share your solution page in the **#finished-projects** channel of the [Slack community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/slack). 
2. Tweet [@frontendmentor](https://twitter.com/frontendmentor) and mention **@frontendmentor**, including the repo and live URLs in the tweet. We'd love to take a look at what you've built and help share it around.
3. Share your solution on other social channels like LinkedIn.
4. Blog about your experience building your project. Writing about your workflow, technical choices, and talking through your code is a brilliant way to reinforce what you've learned. Great platforms to write on are [dev.to](https://dev.to/), [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/), and [CodeNewbie](https://community.codenewbie.org/).

We provide templates to help you share your solution once you've submitted it on the platform. Please do edit them and include specific questions when you're looking for feedback. 

The more specific you are with your questions the more likely it is that another member of the community will give you feedback.
